## Introduction
We propose a simple yet powerful method for compressing the size of deep CNNs based on parameter binarization. The striking difference from most previous work on parameter binarization/quantization lies at different treatments of 1 x 1 convolutions and k x k convolutions (k>1), where we only binarize k x k convolutions into binary patterns.  The resulting networks are referred to as pattern networks. By doing this, we show that previous deep CNNs such as GoogLeNet and Inception-type Nets can be compressed dramatically with marginal drop in performance. Second, in light of the different functionalities of 1 x 1 (data projection/transformation) and k x k convolutions (pattern extraction), we propose a new block structure codenamed the pattern residual block that adds transformed feature maps generated by 1 x 1 convolutions to the pattern feature maps generated by k x k convolutions, based on which we design a small network with ~1 million parameters.  Combining with our parameter binarization, we achieve better performance on ImageNet than using similar sized networks including recently released Google MobileNets.
