## Introduction
SEP-Nets are very small yet powerful deep neural network structures based on the invented techniques pattern binarization, pattern residual blocks and the existing group convolution. The two invented techniques pattern binarization, pattern residual blocks are of their interests. For pattern binarization, the striking difference from most previous work on parameter binarization/quantization lies at different treatments of 1 x 1 convolutions and  k x k convolutions (k>1), where we only binarize k x k convolutions into binary patterns.  The resulting networks are referred to as pattern networks. By doing this, we show that previous deep CNNs such as GoogLeNet and Inception-type Nets can be compressed dramatically with marginal drop in performance. In light of the different functionalities of  1 x 1 (data projection/transformation) and k x k convolutions (pattern extraction), we propose a new block structure codenamed the pattern residual block that adds transformed feature maps generated by 1 x 1 convolutions to the pattern feature maps generated by k x k convolutions. Based on the above techniques, the designed SEP-Net could achieve better performance on ImageNet than using similar sized networks including recently released Google MobileNets.

## Instruction
For Justifying pattern binarization could dramtically compressed original model with marginal drop in performance, we conducted experiments in three steps (shown in the following Fig 1):
